## Lab 6, Baltimore Latin American Female Household 
### First task
Work at R-studio to download and process the data for the final map product.

In Rstudio work with the <i>tidycensus library, ggplot2 library and tidyverse library</i> to have acces to the census data from the census of 2014 and 2019 and start to process the data; I find myself in a confusion point where I was not secure of the steeps that I was following were the same steeps that Dr. Dillon shared.

### [R Notebook code](file:///Users/lauratorres/Documents/UMBC/687%20Advanced%20GIS/capitulos/lab6/Laura_Torres_Lab6.html)

After getting all the data and processed it, I finally save it to be used in QGIS to create the maps.

### Second task

To develop the second part of this Lab 6 I have to do a some search to find videos that guided me to create the **Bivariate Map** in QGIS [Choropleth Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttW9ptW7Y74) also I based on the links Dr. Dillon shared with the class [Bivariate choropleth maps in QGIS](https://bnhr.xyz/2019/09/15/bivariate-choropleths-in-qgis.html) and [Bivariate Choropleth Color Generator](https://observablehq.com/@benjaminadk/bivariate-choropleth-color-generator); with all the data collected and the information given in the different links and documents I began to create the following maps:

### Baltimore Latin American Female Household, 2014 and 2019 
<img src="/lab6/Baltimore_Household_2014-19.jpg?raw=true"/>
In this map I am presenting the variables of female Hispanic population from the data census of 2014 and 2019mall combined together in one map with the variables of Female Hispanic household of the same years.
