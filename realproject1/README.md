### What is the topic?
In the current times the migration process of the different communities to new places is a constant topic on the news, on politics, on the economy and in other parts of the society which have made the migration an important topic of study. In this first project I will be looking the migration flows from different countries to Colombia, the principal idea of this project is to draw a map that will give us the idea of from what countries the immigrant flows are coming to Colombia.
### What are the data and where is the data obtained from (provide links too)?
The data was taken with the main objective of having the results of the last census accomplished in Colombia in 2018. The process of recollecting data from DANE Colombia was stimulating because I had to look for my own data that was not part of any of the data sets or census form USA that were provided in past labs. During the recollection data I realized that is important to create a file with the correct characteristics that will allow QGIS and R programs to read correctly the data obtained.
The recollected data was only based on the last census as I have already said, and I it’s use only to demonstrate the high migration from other countries to Colombia; in this position I am not assuring that these migrants are foreign nationals, as they may be Colombians returning to their country.

### Are there any necessary transformations or subsets you need to do to the data?
The data was transformed on excel to eliminate some columns on the data sheets that were not need. Also, the data was uploaded to R to create the shape file (shp) and finally projected on QGIS, as following it is shown:

### What is the analysis you'll be performing on your data sets?
The analysis realized by using the data obtained is clear showing that Colombia does receives migrants from different parts of the world but more specific from the continent; Colombia is a country where the majority of migrants come from Venezuela and USA, being Venezuela one of the countries with major migration in the continent; and USA one of the countries with major population of migrants from Colombia. To understand the map and the data we must have clear that this map is showing only the movement flows from other countries to Colombia not having in consideration nationality or citizenship. 
In base on above, these maps are showing us the consequent migration flows from countries around the continent to Colombia and their settlement in the country; where the heist settlement of migrants is Bogota D.C, followed by Eje Cafetero, Caribbean cities as Cartagena, Santa Marta and Barranquilla, and finally Cali.
What outputs will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class?
In this part I will be sharing the two maps that were made from the data recollected on DANE’s last census and on ANDA archive data sets. I want to clarify that these maps are a first attempt of the maps that are going to be use for my thesis, recognizing that they are not in their final version.

### Conclusions: 
This project has made me realize the difficultness on getting the data to map and the importance of understanding the correct tools to develop and use correctly the different programs. 
I can conclude that the data recollected on the Colombian census 2018 has shown that the majority of immigrants in Colombia during the census 2018 were coming from Venezuela and the following country was USA. Having in mind that the data is not securing the nationality of these migrants, they can be Colombians returning to their home county. 
As things to improve I recognize the need of understanding and using better the tools that R-studio and QGIS offer to build maps and create data sets.
