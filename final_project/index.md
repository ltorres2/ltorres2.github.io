## Final Project.
<p> The following final project is planned to show the differentiation between two non white populations in New Mexico State. In this project I will be using the variables of Native American and Indigenous population, Hispanic population, the level of income in the state, education - with the sub variables of: enrollment, non enrollment, college, and grad school - these variables are taken from the census track of 2014 and census tract of 2019.</p>
<p> The research question: _Is there a differentiation in New Mexico between Native American and Indigenous population, Hispanic population in relation with income and education level?_ </p> 
 ### Introduction 
 <p> New Mexico is a state of USA which is located at the Southwest of the country and limits with the states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and with Mexico country. The geographic location of New Mexico allows the state to be a diverse and unique place to study. New Mexico is known because of the Native American and Indigenous population, and the influence of the Spanish settlements; to these influences we also recognized New Mexico beacuse of the hight level of hispanic influence, identifying it as the resoult of the USA adquisition of New Mexico from Mexico in 1848, as a result of the Mexican War, and the remainder in the 1853 Gadsden Purchase.</p>
 <p> The vast multicultural influence in New Mexico, its closeness to Mexico, the Native American and Indigienous population, the influence of the Spanish settlements, and the hight level of hispanic influence, has made this State a interesting, important and full of history state; where the inequality and poverty is a big influence factor locating New Mexico in the 3rd place of the poorest states with a _Poverty Rate of 18.2%_  with a 2 million of population which has grown by 1.8%  in the last decade.

 <p> As already described New Mexico state is a place that have different influential factors that do influence the correlation between race, education and income.. Reason why this project is important; I want to bring attention to the census data that has been obtained in relation all these factors. </p>
