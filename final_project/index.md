# Final Project.

The following final project is planned to show the differentiation between two non white populations in New Mexico State. In this project I will be using the variables of Native American and Indigenous population, Hispanic population, the level of income in the state, education - with the sub variables of: enrollment, non enrollment, college, and grad school - these variables are taken from the census track of 2014 and census tract of 2019.

The research question: _Is there a differentiation in New Mexico between Native American and Indigenous population, Hispanic population in relation with income and education level?_ 


 ## Introduction 
 
 
 New Mexico is a state of USA which is located at the Southwest of the country and limits with the states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and with Mexico country. The geographic location of New Mexico allows the state to be a diverse and unique place to study. New Mexico is known because of the Native American and Indigenous population, and the influence of the Spanish settlements; to these influences we also recognized New Mexico beacuse of the hight level of hispanic influence, identifying it as the resoult of the USA adquisition of New Mexico from Mexico in 1848, as a result of the Mexican War, and the remainder in the 1853 Gadsden Purchase.
 
 
 The vast multicultural influence in New Mexico, its closeness to Mexico, the Native American and Indigienous population, the influence of the Spanish settlements, and the hight level of hispanic influence, has made this State a interesting, important and full of history state; where the inequality and poverty is a big influence factor locating New Mexico in the 3rd place of the poorest states with a _Poverty Rate of 18.2%_  with a 2 million of population which has grown by 1.8%  in the last decade. [More information](https://www.safety.com/the-poorest-states-in-america/). 
 
 As already described New Mexico state is a place that have different influential factors that do influence the correlation between race, education and income. Reason why this project is important; I want to bring attention to the census data that has been obtained in relation all these factors. This project wants to create a product that can be used to analyze the factors that can influence the level of life quality in New Mexico State's community. 
 
 
 ## Methods 
 
 
 
 To develop this project, I use R-studio to acquire the data and QGIS to create the visualization of the variables. 


### Data 


The data was obtained from THe United States Census Bureau. [More information](https://www.census.gov/en.html) 
The variables where searched in the Social Explorer, Data Dictionary, for the surveys of 2014 and 2019 [More information](https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2019_5yr/metadata/) 

 #### R-Studio 
 
 
In R-Studio I have the opportunity to create a tutorial where I downloaded the Data and Variables from The United States Census Bureau data base. To Sign-up for a Census API key here is the [link](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html), once you have applied for the key you are able to use the key in R-studio to download the disaried data. 

 In the following [tutorial](/final_project/Laura_Torres_NM_final_project.html) you would be able to dowland and create _geojson_ files that would be use in QGIS to plot the variables relations maps.  

 
#### QGIS 

Once the data was recoded and saved as _geojson_ I begun to create the maps that are being part of the project and that are shoing the information recolledted in order to analize the data obtained form The United States Census Bureau data base.

 ## Conclutions 
 
This project has shown that the indigenous communities have a higher level of enrollment in academic courses than the enrolled variable of the same population. It also shows that the higher income of the state is not in the indigenous reservations or in the indigenous nations, as is the case of Taos NM, La Española, and other counties in New Mexico.

In the Hispanic population case, the project has shown that the highest concentration of hispanic population is in the cities of Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Albuquerque and in the prophecy of them. The enrollment of the hispanic population into an education program is higher than the enrollment of the same population. The income of the state is principally centred in the big cities of Santa Fe and Albuquerque.

Overall the project has shown that the education unenrollment is a high percentage in the state between the Native American and Indigenous and the Hispanic communities. In the 3dr poorest state in USA there are kids and communities that are not having the right of schooling; being New Mexico a state with 121,697 mi² are some counties and towns that do not have schooling opportunities. 

I encourage to apply some other variables, such as transportation facilities, language, work, health and number of schools and universities in this research, for furder projects. 

To finalize, I want to promote the reader to have a trip and meet the beautiful land of New Mexico, the people and the great food.


 ## Difficulties and future improvement 
 
 I Have start this final project with the idea and expectation to create a different map from a Colombian data set form the census of 2005 and 2018; but these data were not in good condition to be used; I expect to inprove my skills and be able to create data bases that I can use to plot different refence maps. In this intent of creating a different project I did learn how to dowloand information of tweets form internte b using R and the funtion of Rtweet. 
 
 You can see the Rtweet tutorial [here](/final_project/tweeter.html).
 
Over all, I am glad that I got through the GIS Class and I have learned much more than I expected. I got the opportunity to experience and face new challenges that I was not able to face before.
